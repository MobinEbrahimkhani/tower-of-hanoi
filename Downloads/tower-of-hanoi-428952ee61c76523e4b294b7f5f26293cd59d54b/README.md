Here is how to play:

1- Choose the number of disks you want to play with and push the 'Submit the number of disks' button.

2- Choose the pole you want to take a disk from adn push the 'Submit origin pole' button. (make sure the pole has disks on it or you will get an 'invalid move' error!)

3- Choose the pole you want to put the disk you just picked on and push the 'Submit destination pole' button. (and also make sure that the pole does not contain a smaller disk or you will the 'invalid move' error again)

4- Watch the disk get moved to teh destination pole
